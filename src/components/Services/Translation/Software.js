      <p>Software is one of the most difficult products to translate effectively. In addition to ensuring that every textual aspect of the interface has been completely translated, it is important to localize the interface in every way possible. Standards for display of various forms of information vary wildly between cultures. To localize software effectively, Zeeba H Solutions provides foreign-language QA services to pilot the software in the target languages. This ensures there are no concatenation issues or related bugs in the target language prior to launch.</p>
      <p>When translating software, it may also be necessary to localize additional collateral, such as marketing materials and technical documentation. Since all of these items draw upon the content of your software, having them translated by the same professional organization is an ideal solution. Zeeba H Solutions is positioned to help you not only with translating your software, but with everything that goes along with it, ensuring a cohesive, coherent experience that will help make your product a success in its target market. Additionally, once we have worked with you to localize your content for a single foreign market, it becomes much easier and faster to build on the process later.</p>

      <p>If users do not experience the functionality from your product they expect, you will not get the sales you desire. A big part of functionality is ensuring that users understand your interface and are able to find content and achieve their goals. Seconds count in software, so any form of confusion can cause users to bounce from your software. A professional translation can make it more than 50% more likely that a user from another culture will continue to enjoy your productâ€” making it far more likely that he or she will continue to do business with you in the future. Translation is one of the most critical aspects of your global bottom line.</p>
