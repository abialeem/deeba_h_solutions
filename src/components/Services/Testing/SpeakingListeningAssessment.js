Through a series of carefully designed questions, this exam is aimed at eliciting a candidate’s ability to converse in the language being tested. The candidate is asked a series of questions that gradually increase in complexity, requiring the candidate to perform various spoken tasks. In doing so, Zeeba H Solutions’s evaluators are able to accurately rate how well a candidate can speak the language according to our scale.

Zeeba H Solutions offers the Speaking and Listening Assessment in two formats—live and IVR (Interactive Voice Response) to give you the flexibility your company needs. The live assessment is available on a prescheduled basis, with most languages available to be tested the following business day. The IVR testing option is an automated delivery system that allows you to set up your candidate’s test at any time, and is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week*. No matter which version you choose, you receive the same Zeeba H Solutions quality and results the next business day.

    >
        <p style={{lineHeight:'32px',fontSize:'19px',color:'grey'}}>

        Every Speaking and Listening Assessment administered by Zeeba H Solutions, whether through the live assessment or over IVR, is scored by a highly trained human evaluator—not a machine. This gives our clients a level of quality that cannot be matched by fully automated assessments. In addition, Zeeba H Solutions uses a crosschecking process to continually review the results we send out, making sure that our clients receive accurate ratings every time. We are proud to say that we maintain an exceptional inter-rater reliability (the degree to which two raters independently provide the same score on the same exam). This means that we can keep our costs lower, and pass our savings along to you. Thus, we can remain one of the most competitively priced language testing companies in the business.
